# Boundary-Layer-Solver-over-Plate-MATLAB
**Description**
This repository contains MATLAB implementations for solving the Prandtl Boundary Layer equations for flow over a flat plate with zero pressure gradient. The project compares numerical solutions against the analytical Blasius solution. The freestream Reynolds number is approximately $5 \times 10^5$.
